# End-to-End Spam Detection System

# Overview

The End-to-End Spam Detection System is a machine learning project aimed at classifying messages (such as emails or SMS) into two categories: Spam and Ham (not spam). This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques combined with Machine Learning algorithms to build an effective spam detection system.


# Project Structure

1. Data Loading and Exploration
Load the dataset and perform an initial exploration to understand the structure and content of the data.

2. Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the text data to make it suitable for model training. This involves steps like tokenization, removing stopwords, and text normalization.

3. Feature Extraction (TF-IDF)
Extract features from the text data using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to convert textual data into numerical features.

4. Model Training and Evaluation
Train various machine learning models, evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score), and compare the results.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize the model by fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve performance.

6. Final Model and Prediction
Select the best-performing model, finalize it, and use it to make predictions on unseen data.
